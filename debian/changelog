  * debian/templates/libnvidia-gl-flavour.{install|links}.in:
    Include libnvidia-vulkan-producer.so now that
    libnvidia-egl-wayland1 is in main (LP: #1935082).
  * debian/templates/control.in:
    - Add build dependency on libnvidia-egl-wayland1.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-495 (495.46-0ubuntu1) jammy; urgency=medium

  * debian/additional_card_ids:
    - Add the following IDs:
      1FBC 249C 249D 24B6 24B7 24B8 25A0 25B8
  * New upstream release (LP: #1954818):
    - Added support for the GBM API. This adds the new symlink
      nvidia-drm_gbm.so pointing to the file libnvidia-
      allocator.so.VERSION to implement a GBM backend driver usable
      with the GBM loader from the Mesa project version 21.2 and
      above, as well as the files libnvidia-egl-gbm.so.1.1.0 and
      15_nvidia_gbm.json, which implement EGL support for the GBM
      platform (EGL_KHR_platform_gbm).
    - Add indicator for Resizable BAR support on compatible systems.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash when
      starting a new server generation on PRIME configurations.
    - Removed support for NvIFROpenGL. This functionality was
      deprecated in the 470.xx driver release.
    - Removed libnvidia-cbl.so from the driver package. This
      functionality is now provided by other driver libraries.
    - Changed the minimum required Linux kernel version from 2.6.32
      to 3.10.
    - Updated nvidia.ko to load even if no supported NVIDIA GPUs are
      present when an NVIDIA NVSwitch device is detected in the
      system. Previously, nvidia.ko would fail to load into the
      kernel if no supported GPUs were present.
    - Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver where unused input attributes
      to a vertex shader would corrupt the interpolation qualifiers
      for the shader.
    - Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver where individual components of
      barycentric inputs could not be read.
    - Added support for the VK_KHR_present_id extension.
    - Added support for the VK_KHR_present_wait extension.
    - Added support for the
      VK_KHR_shader_subgroup_uniform_control_flow extension.
    - Fixed a bug where VK_NVX_binary_import was advertised as
      supported on unsupported platforms. This caused calls to
      vkCreateDevice to fail if applications attempted to enable
      VK_NVX_binary_import on such platforms.
    - Added a new command line option, "--no-peermem", to nvidia-
      installer. Selecting this option prevents the installation of
      the nvidia-peermem kernel module.
    - Fixed a regression which prevented DisplayPort and HDMI 2.1
      variable refresh rate (VRR) G-SYNC Compatible monitors from
      functioning correctly in variable refresh rate mode, resulting
      in issues such as flickering.
    - Fixed a bug that can cause a kernel crash in SLI Mosaic
      configurations.
    - Added support for the EGL_NV_robustness_video_memory_purge
      extension.
