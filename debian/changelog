      correctly enumerating GPUs on systems with multiple GPUs where
      access to the GPU device files was restricted for some GPUs.
    - Fixed a regression that could cause system hangs when changing
      display resolution on SLI Mosaic configurations.
    - Fixed a bug that could result in blank displays when driving
      multiple displays at the same resolution using active
      DisplayPort dongles.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-460 (460.67-0ubuntu0.20.04.1) focal; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a bug where using ray tracing extensions on multi-GPU
      setups could result in application instability if the GPUs did
      not match.
    - Fixed an issue that prevented G-SYNC from working properly
      after a mode switch on Kepler-based GPUs.
    - Fixed a driver installation failure on Linux kernel 5.11
      release candidates, where the NVIDIA kernel module failed to
      build with error
      "error: implicit declaration of function 'sys_close'".
    - Fixed a bug where vkCreateSwapchain could cause the X Server to
      crash when an invalid imageFormat was provided.
    - Fixed a driver installation failure on Linux kernel 5.11
      release candidates, where the NVIDIA kernel module failed to
      build with error
      "fatal error: asm/kmap_types.h: No such file or directory".
