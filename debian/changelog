nvidia-graphics-drivers-460 (460.32.03-0ubuntu1) hirsute; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
        RTX A6000
    - Fixed a bug that could cause detailed timing information for
      displays with a large number of detailed timings to be
      truncated in the X log.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented scaled display resolutions
      configured via the nvidia-settings control panel from being
      reported by RandR.
    - Fixed a bug with the SLI Mosaic Mode configuration dialog in
      nvidia-settings that left displays enabled when they were not
      needed in the selected configuration.
    - Added support for RandR rotation and reflection while using an
      NVIDIA-driven display as a PRIME Display Offload sink.
    - Added support for "Reverse PRIME Bypass", an optimization that
      bypasses the bandwidth overhead of PRIME Render Offload and
      PRIME Display Offload in conditions where a render offload
      application is fullscreen, unredirected, and visible only on a
      given NVIDIA-driven PRIME Display Offload output. Use of the
      optimization is reported in the X log when verbose logging is
      enabled in the X server.
    - Add support for the VK_KHR_acceleration_structure extension.
    - Add support for the VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline extension.
    - Add support for the VK_KHR_ray_query extension.
    - Add support for the VK_KHR_pipeline_library extension.
    - Add support for the VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations extension.
    - Removed the MetaMode string truncation warning for older X
      Servers when saving the X Configuration file from nvidia-
      settings.
    - Add support for the VK_NV_fragment_shading_rate_enums
      extension.
    - Fixed a bug where copying from an X11 pixmap to an RGB overlay
      window would exhibit corruption.
    - Fixed an issue with VK_ACCESS_MEMORY_READ_BIT and
      VK_ACCESS_MEMORY_WRITE_BIT when used as part of a render pass.
    - Add support for the VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate extension.
    - Add support for the VK_KHR_shader_terminate_invocation
      extension.
    - Reduce host memory consumption for descriptor memory in cases
      where the pNext chain contains a structure of type
      VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR_SET_VARIABLE_DESCRIPTOR_COUNT_ALLO
      CATE_INFO.
    - Increased the default size for new OpenGL/Vulkan Shader Disk
      Cache location to 1024MB. Note that caches with paths
      containing "/.nv/ will continue to use the previous default of
      128MB unless the size is manually overridden. For more
      information see the "OpenGL Shader Disk Cache" section in the
      "Specifying OpenGL Environment Variable Settings" chapter of
      the README.
    - Changed the default location for new OpenGL/Vulkan Shader Disk
      Caches. If the location is not manually overridden and a cache
      is detected in the previous default location, that location
      will be used instead of the new default location. For more
      information see the "OpenGL Shader Disk Cache" section in the
      "Specifying OpenGL Environment Variable Settings" chapter of
      the README.
    - Add support for the VK_EXT_shader_image_atomic_int64 extension.
    - Add support for the VK_KHR_copy_commands2 extension.
    - Allow importing cached memory via VK_EXT_external_memory_host.
    - Removed support for the following deprecated frame lock NV-
      CONTROL attributes:
        NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MASTER
        NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SLAVES
        NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MASTERABLE
        NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SLAVEABLE
    - Default AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration to True such that the
      NVIDIA X driver succeeds when launching the X server even if
      there are no display devices connected.
    - RRGetCrtcInfo will now return Rotate_0 instead of 0 as the
      active rotation for disabled CRTCs.
    - Improved the NVIDIA VDPAU implementation of
      VdpVideoSurfaceGetBitsYCbCr and VdpVideoSurfacePutBitsYCbCr
      when using planar or semi-planar formats.Â  This helps
      applications that transfer data between VDPAU video surfaces
      and system memory.
    - Added initial experimental support for S0ix-based system
      suspend (suspend-to-idle). This feature is platform and GPU
      dependent, so the feature will be disabled by default. To
      enable this feature, refer to the 'powermanagement' section of
      the README.
    - Fixed an issue where Vulkan applications would fail to
      initialize if the connected X11 Server did not expose support
      for GLX.
    - Improved the memory allocation strategy in nvidia-modeset.ko to
      reduce the likelihood of out-of-memory errors, which typically
      manifest as "page allocation failure" messages in the kernel
      log.
    - Added a new "NoInterlacedModes" token to the NVIDIA X driver's
      "ModeValidation" option, to allow preventing interlaced modes
      from being validated. Refer to the "X Config Options" appendix
      of the driver README for further details.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause X clients to crash when closing
      display connections to the X server.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to configure
      DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport displays in an inconsistent
      order.
    - Fixed an interaction problem with 5.4 and newer Linux kernels
      that caused a performance regression when allocating system
      memory.
